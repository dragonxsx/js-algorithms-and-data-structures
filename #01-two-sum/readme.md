# Question
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a given target

## Step 1: Verify the constrainsts
- All numbers are positive
- There are no duplicates
- If there's no solution, return null
- There is always a solution
- Only 1 pair of numbers add up to the target
## Step 2: Write some test cases
- ([1, 3, 5, 7, 12], 15) => [1, 4]
- ([1, 3, 5, 7, 12], 25) => null
- ([1, 9], 15) => null
- ([1], 15) => null
- ([1, 14], 15) => [0, 1]
## Step 3: Figure out a brute force solution
## Step 4: Write solution in code
## Step 5: Double check for errors
## Step 6: Test solution with test cases
## Step 7: Analyzing Space & Time Complexity
## Step 8: Optimize the solution
