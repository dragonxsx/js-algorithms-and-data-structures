# Arrays - Container with most water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
# Question
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Step 1: Verify the constrainsts

## Step 2: Write some test cases
- [7,1,2,3,9] => 7 * 4 = 28
- [] => 0
- [7] => 0
- [6,9,3,4,5,8] => (6*5=30) < (8*4=32) => 32
## Step 3: Figure out a brute force solution
## Step 4: Write solution in code
## Step 5: Double check for errors
## Step 6: Test solution with test cases
## Step 7: Analyzing Space & Time Complexity
## Step 8: Optimize the solution
